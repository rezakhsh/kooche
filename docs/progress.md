# Progress

## Oct 16, 2026: infrastructure foundation

Done:
- Coolify repaired (broken IPv6 Docker network) and running at https://coolify.taskpilot.dev. Admin account created, public registration off.
- Hetzner firewall `classifieds-app` attached: only 22, 80, 443 open.
- Storage Box BX11 `classifieds-backups` in Falkenstein for off-site backups.
- Nightly encrypted restic backup (`/usr/local/bin/classifieds-backup`, cron 03:15 UTC) of Coolify config and server secrets to the Storage Box. First snapshot taken and a restore tested. PostgreSQL dumps get added when the database is deployed.
- Setup reviewed and decisions written to `docs/setup.md`.

Next:
1. Resolve the open decisions in `docs/setup.md` (R2 for photos, server backups, brand and domain).
2. Phase 2 of the plan: design the full PostgreSQL schema and get it approved before any feature code.
